If the R is far from P
Then you have a first degree
Longer, longer, longer, drop!
Then you have a Wenckebach.
If some Ps don't get through,
Then you have a Morbitz II.
If Ps and Qs don't agree,
Then you have a third degree.
High Ts, that's the way,
Sounds like a hyper-K.
If the ST's also high,
Dude, you've got acute MI.
Fast and narrow, null T-P,
That'd be an SVT.
Fast and wide, no RST,
That'd be a nice VT.
You see M on leftmost V
That's a block of LBB
